# Hands-on_Lecture_2
This repository consists of two Java files with algorithms solving two LeetCode problems and a test_cases Java main file, which tests both Java solutions with sample test cases. It also includes this README file to describe the repository and the problems being solved.

Problems:
1. Pascal's Triangle
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle. In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example: 
Input: 5
Output:
[
 [1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]

2. Spiral Matrix
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example:
Input: 
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
